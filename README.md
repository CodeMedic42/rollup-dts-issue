### Setup

1. npm i
2. npm run build

### Issue

1. dts files show up in dist under a folder called src. I have no idea why.
2. I would prefer the dts file to be located in the folder for the component and hook they are meant for.

### Notes
Please be aware this is a heavily watered down representation of a much larger React component/hook library.
